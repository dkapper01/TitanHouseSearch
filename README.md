## TitanSearch

[TitanSearch](https://dkapper01.github.io/TitanHouseSearch/)

The primary function of TitanSearch is to find the most in-demand executives at the largest corporations in the U.S. and Canada. If the executives have profiles on LinkedIn or Bloomberg, the custom search engine immediately renders those profile URLs to the screen inside the web application. It is an intuitive but at the same time powerful web application. I built TitanSearch with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and Google Custom Search API. The application returns the results via HTML iframe. My colleagues at TitanHouse, a startup in Washington D.C., used it around 40,000 times in just six months and reported at least a 50% increase in their productivity.
