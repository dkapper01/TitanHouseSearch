## TitanSearch

[TitanSearch](https://dkapper01.github.io/TitanHouseSearch/)

TitanSearch main function is to find the most in-demand executives at the largest corporations in the US and Canada. By searching with the custom search engine and if the executives have profiles with Linkedin.com and Bloomberg.com, it will Immediately render those profile URLs to the screen inside the application. It is an intuitive web application meant to be easy to use but at the same time powerful for the user. I built TitanSearch with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and Google Custom Search API. The application returns the results via HTML iframe. TitanSearch substantially increased the productivity of my colleagues at TitanHouse, a startup in Washington D.C. In just six months it was used nearly 40,000 times.


[I used Google Custom Search API to build TitanSearch](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/docs/overview)
