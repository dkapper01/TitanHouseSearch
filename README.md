TitanSearch was made to help my colleagues find executives in the US and Canada. TitanSearch finds executives Linkedin and Bloomberg profiles. It is an intuitive and well-designed web application. When searching the executive's name and organization most often the first two results will be the ones you want. In this application, Google Custom Search API returns the results via HTML iframe. TitanSearch substantially increased the productivity of my colleagues. In just six months it was used nearly 40,000 times.
